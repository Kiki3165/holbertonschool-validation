## Introduction to DevOps: Automate Everything to Focus on What Really Matters

Congratulations!

It’s your first day at “Awesome Inc.” as a software engineer. This company is currently experiencing fast growth and hired you to work on their web services.

Your predecessor left to travel the world, and the expectations are high on your ability to help "Awesome Inc.” to grow a culture of collaboration with a technical mindset, while managing their existing web services. That’s exactly what DevOps is about!
